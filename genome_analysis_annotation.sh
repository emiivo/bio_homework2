# First step for genome analysis and annotation is using Gepard to create dotplots between samples. I did this through my own computer, 
# results can be found in moodle.
# I compared both SPAdes and ABySS scaffolds, but the I analyse AbySS assemblies, the more I believe my ABySS assemblies have either been made incorrectly
# or I compromised them in a different step. The low mapping could an indicator of the assemblies not being correct. The dotplots do show coorelation,
# but they are distorted and I am not sure they can even be analised properly.

# As for the SPAdes samples, these are the results I got:
# 1) ERR204044 and SRR15131330 - the dotplot indicates the sequences align in many areas, suggesting the sequences are similar.
# This suggests that they may share common genomic regions or have similar genetic content.
# 2) SRR18214264 and ERR204044 - the dotplot also shows that the sequences are similar, but they have more areas that differ in comparrisson to 
# the ERR204044 and SRR15131330 dotplot. The differences observed in the dotplot suggest variations or divergent regions between the two samples,
# indicating distinct genomic features or genetic differences.
# 3) SRR18214264 and SRR15131330 - the dotplot is very similar to dotplot of ERR204044 and SRR15131330, indicating a high level of sequence 
# alignment and similarity between these two samples.
